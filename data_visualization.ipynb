    "For this data science project, we will analyze the data of global COVID-19 daily cases and deaths by date reported to WHO, as of the end of 2021, from the [WHO COVID-19 Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/data). The data contains the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Date_reported: Date variable, Date of reporting to WHO.\n",
    "* Country_code: String variable, ISO Alpha-2 country code.\n",
    "* Country: String variable, country, territory, area.\n",
    "* WHO_region: String variable, WHO regional offices: WHO Member States are grouped into six WHO regions -- Regional Office for Africa (AFRO), Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO), Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO), Regional Office for Europe (EURO), Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO), and Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO).\n",
    "* New_cases: Integer variable, New confirmed cases. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative case count from current cumulative cases count.*\n",
    "* Cumulative_cases: Integer variable, Cumulative confirmed cases reported to WHO to date.\n",
    "* New_deaths: Integer variable, New confirmed deaths. Calculated by subtracting previous cumulative deaths from current cumulative deaths.*\n",
    "* Cumulative_deaths: Integer variable, Cumulative confirmed deaths reported to WHO to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *New case and death counts: Counts of new cases and deaths are calculated by subtracting previous cumulative total counts from the current count. These counts are updated incrementally throughout the day as more information becomes available. Daily new case and death counts are complete by 23:59 CET/CEST each day. Due to differences in reporting methods, cut-off times, retrospective data consolidation and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always reflect daily totals published by individual countries, territories or areas. Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, such data may reflect as negative numbers in the new cases / new deaths counts as appropriate. This will aid users in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, data will be updated accordingly.\n"
